A part of the article:

Every time I stub a method, I make an assumption about what values that method can return. To check that assumption, I have to write a test that expects the return value Iâ€™ve just stubbed. I use only basic logic there: if A depends on B returning x, then I have to know that B can return x, so I have to write a test for that.
